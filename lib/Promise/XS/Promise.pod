=head1 NAME

Promise::XS::Promise - promise object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<Promise::XS>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is L<Promise::XS>’s actual promise object class. It implements
these methods:

=over

=item * C<then()>

=item * C<catch()>

=item * C<finally()>

=back

… which behave as they normally do in promise implementations.

=head1 NOTES

Subclassing this class won’t work because the above-named methods always
return instances of (exactly) this class. That may change eventually,
but for now this is what’s what.
